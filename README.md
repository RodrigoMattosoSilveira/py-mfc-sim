## The PPP workflows
A `PPP` has the following workflows:
* 70% PnP;
* 15% Receiving and Cleaning;
*  5% Cycle Count;
*  5% Parcel Level Scanning (TRIPS);
A `PPP` mission is to fulfill `orders`. The `PPP` executes its mission through repeated executions of the `PnP` cycle; they work `SHIFT_WORK_DURATION` hours, performs `PnP tasks`, takes periodic `shift breaks` and `hourly breaks` in between ` their PnP` work.

  * arrives at the order area
  * requests order tablet, waits for tablet
  * requests next order, waits for the next order
  * gets, reads, and memorizes the order
  * decides how many containers for the order
  * retrieves the order's container(s), they are always available
    * 1 bags for rush / same day
    * 1+ boxes for next day / national (1 container per 6 eaches)
    * PPP aborts order fulfillment when OOP
* pick an order
  * walks to pick area
  * Repeat until picked items == order items
    * Repeat until items in container == items per container
      * picks the next order item

# Simulation
We will simulate multiple `PPP` executing their missions concurrently; they will work `SHIFT_WORK_DURATION` hours, performing their `PnP tasks`, takes periodic `shift breaks` and `hourly breaks` in between ` their PnP` work.

We will simulate `PnP tasks` by randomizing the time, in simulation ticks equivalent to seconds. For example, we simulate a `PPP` walking between two points in the warehouse by picking a rondom number from a normal distribution with a reaosble average to walk the distance and a narrow standard deviation.

We will simulate scarce resources by waiting for the resource to become available, as for instance the order tablet, or by aborting the `PnP` mission, as for instance when packing resources are not available.

Following we describe how use SimPy's `events`, `resources` and `process` to model our MFCs.

## Events
We will use events to simulate actual `PnP` activities, and capture them as the time to execute these activities. There are few distinct distributions:
### Absolute
These are configurable values used as is. For example, the shift duration in parameters.SHIFT_WORK_DURATION

### Normal
These are configurable values used to generate a random value based on a normal distribution around a mean with a narrow standard deviation. 

For example, we calculate the time to walk to the pick area, by selecting a random number from a normal distribution between
* parameters.TIME_TO_WALK_TO_PICK_STATION_MIN, and 
* parameters.TIME_TO_WALK_TO_PICK_STATION_MAX

### Arbitrary
These are configurable values used to generate a random value based on a arbitrary distribution around certain known values. 

For example, we estimate whether a product is available using an arbitrary probability that the probability that a product will be available to be
* parameters.INVENTORY_AVAILABILITY_PROBABILITY, based on today's inventory accuracy.

## Resources
Resources are things that `processes` use to execute a task. We will model two types of resources:
* **Wait** - the `PPP` waits until this resource is available;
* **Abort** - `PPP` aborts the `PnP` cycle if this resource is unavailable;

### Wait
* **order tablet** There is one per warehouse; 
* **stage area** There are `STAGE_AREAS` per warehouse; 
* **label printer** There `LABEL_PRINTERS` per warehouse;

### Abort
* **product** There is a `INVENTORY_AVAILABILITY_PROBABILITY` probability that this resource is available;
* **bag** There is a `BAG_AVAILABILITY_PROBABILITY` probability that this resource is available;
* **box** There is a `BOX_AVAILABILITY_PROBABILITY` probability that this resource is available;
* **label** There is a `LABEL_AVAILABILITY_PROBABILITY` probability that this resource is available;
* **delivery fridge** There is a `DELIVERY_FRIDGE_AVAILABILITY_PROBABILITY` probability that this resource is available;

## Processes
We describe the the `PnP`above, on the `The Pick and Pack Cycle` section.
